## How to obtain cookie (the right way)

Step 1: Go to the brick hill dashboard

Step 2: Open Inspect Element

Step 3: Go to the "Network" tab on the top, you might have to click the arrow and find network in there.

Step 4: Refresh the page and find the button labeled "dashboard" in the network tab.

Step 5: Click it and scroll down until you see the label that says "set-cookie". There should be 2, find the one that says brick_hill_session next to it.

Step 6: Copy everything in that cookie except for the brick_hill_session= part of it.

And with that you should have your very cool cookie. keep in mind that it does have a expiration date. probably not for like a week though
